## Ethical Considerations and Antitrust of Big Tech

This paper begins by defining three key terms: big tech, big data, and antitrust. 
The humble origins of Amazon are summarized, and the company's poor privacy practices, anticompetitive business strategies, and unethical treatment of workers are discussed. 
Business acquisitions and the merging of Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and Whatsapp operating systems are provided as evidence to Meta's antitrust violations. 
Finally, two ethical frameworks and their relationship to big data and big tech are described.
